This is a collection of methods for quickly downloading downscaled global climate model (GCM) data covering specified areas for 
use in the USGS NCCASC Climate Scenario Toolbox.

The Climate Scenario Toolbox is an R package that allows users to quickly query downscaled Global Climate Models for
a variety of climate variables for a specified area and future time period. 

The GCM data is downscaled to a 4km resolution via the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs method (MACA).
